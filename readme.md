```
composer require --dev dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer:"0.7.1 as 0.6.0" pheromone/phpcs-security-audit:dev-master
composer require pheromone/phpcs-security-audit:dev-master
```

`./vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=Security --report=./vendor/symbiote/phpcs-sonar/src/Sonar.php path/ > report-file.json`
